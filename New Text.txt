### Website Layout 
 
#### 1. Home Page (Landing Page) 
Purpose: Provide an overview of HDS and its value to petroleum companies. 
 
- Header:  
  - Logo (HDS with a subtle drilling or hydraulic icon). 
  - Navigation bar (links: Modules, Features, Contact). 
   
- Hero Section: 
  - Tagline: _"Revolutionize Your Oil Well Drilling with Real-Time Simulations."_ 
  - Subheading: _"Powerful tools to optimize, simulate, and master drilling operations."_   
  - Call-to-action (CTA): _"Learn More"_ button (scrolls down) and _"Contact Us"_ (anchors to the contact section). 
  - Background: Subtle 3D animation or graphic showcasing drilling. 
 
- Overview Section: 
  - Brief description of what HDS is and its key benefits. 
  - Highlight key features: 
    - Real-time simulations. 
    - 9 integrated modules. 
    - 3D graphics. 
 
#### 2. Modules Page 
Purpose: Showcase the nine modules in detail. 
 
- Section Layout: A grid or list view with icons for each module. 
  - Gyroscopic Calculators: Optimal RPM for drilling. 
  - Drill Ahead: ECD, cutting load, and more. 
  - Hydraulics: Comprehensive drilling hydraulics simulation. 
  - Fluid Displacement: Accurate modeling. 
  - Drilling Optimization: Suggestions for enhanced efficiency. 
  - Well Control: Monitoring and solutions. 
  - Surge and Swab: Detect and mitigate. 
  - Salt Tables: Advanced salt stratification tools. 
  - MUC Calculation and Wellset: Fracture analysis and fixes. 
  - Torque and Drag: Real-time feedback. 
 
Each module description can include: 
- A small icon or visual. 
- A short paragraph about its purpose and how it helps. 
- Example outputs or use cases. 
 
#### 3. Features Page 
Purpose: Highlight the standout aspects of HDS beyond its modules. 
 
- Real-time Simulations: Everything updates simultaneously. 
- 3D Visualizations: See the hole, casing, drill string, and surveys live. 
- File Storage and Sharing: Export files easily to share with your team. 
- User-friendly Interface: Simplified navigation and intuitive design. 
   
- Optionally include a video demo or carousel of images/screenshots. 
 
#### 4. Contact Page 
Purpose: Allow visitors to easily contact you for inquiries or purchases. 
 
- Contact Form: 
  - Name, Email, Company Name, Message. 
  - "Submit" button. 
   
- Direct Contact Details: 
  - Email: sales@yourcompany.com. 
  - Phone: +1-234-567-8901. 
   
- Location: Add your office address (optional). 
 
- CTA: _"Get in touch today to revolutionize your drilling process!"_

### Design Principles 
- Theme: Professional, clean, with colors like blue, white, and gray to evoke trust and technology. 
- Fonts: Modern sans-serif fonts like Inter or Roboto. 
- Icons and Graphics: Use clean, minimalistic icons for modules and 3D renders for visuals. 
- Responsive Design: Ensure the website looks great on both desktop and mobile.

### Technical Recommendations 
- Framework: Use modern technologies like React.js or Next.js for a fast, responsive website. 
- Hosting: Use services like Vercel or Netlify. 
- CMS: Optional; if you want to update content frequently, integrate a headless CMS like Contentful or Strapi. 
- Analytics: Add tools like Google Analytics to track user interactions.
